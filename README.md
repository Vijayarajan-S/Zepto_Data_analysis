E-Commerce Data Analysis Project – Zepto Case Study using SQL & PostgreSQL
This project is a complete end-to-end SQL case study on a real-world e-commerce dataset inspired by Zepto, one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. It's more than just SQL queries — it replicates the daily responsibilities of a data analyst, from importing raw retail data to deriving actionable business insights.

💡 Perfect for Data Analyst job applications and portfolio building!

🚀 Project Objectives

🔍 Simulate a real data analyst workflow:

Import and structure a messy retail dataset in PostgreSQL

Clean, explore, and analyze the data using advanced SQL

Deliver insights that drive decision-making

📦 Dataset
Realistic inventory and sales data modeled after Zepto

Includes product names, categories, pricing (in paise), inventory levels, and timestamps

Data contains imperfections such as:

Missing values

Zero-priced items

Inconsistent units (e.g., paise instead of rupees)

🔧 Tools Used
SQL: Core analysis, cleaning, and business logic

PostgreSQL: Database setup and management

pgAdmin: GUI for querying and visualizing data

Git: Version control and project tracking

🔍 Key Steps and Tasks
1. 📥 Data Setup & Import
Created database and tables in PostgreSQL

Imported raw .csv files into the system using COPY and pgAdmin

2. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and handled:

Missing and duplicate records

Zero pricing and null inventory values

Converted pricing from paise to rupees for better readability

3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explored product categories, inventory distribution, and pricing

Identified best-selling items and underperforming products

Analyzed SKU-level data quality and completeness

4. 💼 Business Insights with SQL
Calculated total revenue per category and item

Performed stock level analysis for restocking decisions

Segmented products based on:

Revenue performance

Inventory turnover rate

Price bands (low, medium, premium)
